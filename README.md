# embedded-intelligent-control
This course provided hands-on experience designing and coding in C embedded control systems, bridging hardwareâ€“software integration with concepts applicable to data acquisition, real-time processing, and automation. 

## Lab 2 - Digital Inputs and Outputs: 
Learn to program the microcontroller to read digital inputs from a pushbutton and control LEDs as digital outputs. Gain experience creating projects, configuring ports, and managing digital signals.

## Lab 3 - Timers and PWM: 
Configure and use timers to generate precise timing signals and PWM outputs. Develop reusable timer functions and control LEDs and servomotors with varying frequencies and duty cycles.

## Lab 4 - Interruptions: 
Understand and implement hardware interrupts to handle simultaneous synchronous and asynchronous tasks efficiently. Use interrupts to generate PWM signals and control LEDs and servos without blocking the main program.

## Lab 5 - Light Intensity Control: 
Design a complete system with a light-dependent resistor and an incandescent bulb. Measure light intensity via ADC, linearize sensor output, and generate PWM signals to modulate bulb brightness according to ambient light levels.
